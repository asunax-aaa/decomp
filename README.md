# decomp
A Python 3.9 bytecode decompiler, currently in the making...

# Why?
Other python bytecode decompilers such as Pycdc or decompyle3 do not currently support Python 3.9 (alteast not fully).

- [Pycdc](https://github.com/zrax/pycdc) - A decompiler written in C++, it works fine but some OPCODEs are not yet fully implemeneted, I would implement them myself but C++ isn't my thing.
- [decompyle3](https://github.com/rocky/python-decompile3) - A decompiler written in Python, fully supports versions 3.7-3.8, the developer (rocky) is not planning on adding Python 3.9 support.
